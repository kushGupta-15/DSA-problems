### 📝 Problem Statement

Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with V vertices numbered from 0 to V - 1 and E weighted directed edges represented by a 2D array edges[][], where edges[i] = [u, v, wt] denotes a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v with weight wt, find the shortest distance from the source vertex 0 to every other vertex.
Return an array of size V, where the i-th element represents the shortest distance from the source vertex 0 to vertex i. If a vertex is not reachable from the source, return -1 for that vertex.
Examples :


### Input:
 V = 4, edges = [[0,1,2], [0,2,1]]


### Output:
 [0, 2, 1, -1]

### Explanation:
 Shortest path from 0 to 1 is 0->1 with edge weight 2. Shortest path from 0 to 2 is 0->2 with edge weight 1. There is no way we can reach 3, so it's -1 for 3.


### Input:
 V = 6, edges = [[0,1,2], [0,4,1], [4,5,4], [4,2,2], [1,2,3], [2,3,6], [5,3,1]]


### Output:
 [0, 2, 3, 6, 1, 5]

### Explanation:
 Shortest path from 0 to 1 is 0->1 with edge weight 2. Shortest path from 0 to 2 is 0->4->2 with edge weight 1+2=3. Shortest path from 0 to 3 is 0->4->5->3 with edge weight 1+4+1=6. Shortest path from 0 to 4 is 0->4 with edge weight 1.Shortest path from 0 to 5 is 0->4->5 with edge weight 1+4=5.
Constraint:1 ≤ V ≤ 1001 ≤ E ≤ min((V*(V-1))/2,4000)0 ≤ edges[i][0], edges[i][1] < V0 ≤  edges[i][2] ≤105
