### 📝 Problem Statement

Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with V vertices numbered from 0 to V - 1 and E directed edges represented by a 2D array edges[][], where edges[i] = [u, v] denotes a directed edge from vertex u to vertex v, return a topological ordering of all the vertices.
A topological ordering is a linear ordering of the vertices such that for every directed edge u -> v, vertex u appears before vertex v in the ordering.
Note: As there are multiple Topological orders possible, you may return any of them. If your returned Topological sort is correct then the output will be true else false.
Examples:


### Input:
 V = 4, E = 3, edges[][] = [[3, 0], [1, 0], [2, 0]]

### Output:
 true

### Explanation:
 The output true denotes that the order is valid. Few valid Topological orders for the given graph are:
[3, 2, 1, 0][1, 2, 3, 0][2, 3, 1, 0]


### Input:
 V = 6, E = 6, edges[][] = [[1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 1], [4, 0], [5, 0], [5, 2]]

### Output:
 true


### Explanation:
 The output true denotes that the order is valid. Few valid Topological orders for the graph are:[4, 5, 0, 1, 2, 3][5, 2, 4, 0, 1, 3]


### Constraints:
2  ≤  V  ≤  5 x 1031  ≤  E = edges.size()  ≤  min[105, (V * (V - 1)) / 2]0 ≤ edges[i][0], edges[i][1] < V
