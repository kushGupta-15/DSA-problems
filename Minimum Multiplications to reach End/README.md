### 📝 Problem Statement

Given two integers, start and end, along with an array of integers arr[]. In one operation, you can multiply the current value by any element from arr[], and then take the result modulo 1000 to obtain a new value.
Find the minimum steps in which end can be achieved starting from start. If it is not possible to reach end, then return -1.
Examples :


### Input:
 arr[] = [2, 5, 7], start = 3, end = 30


### Output:
 2


### Explanation:

Step 1: 3*2 = 6 % 1000 = 6 
Step 2: 6*5 = 30 % 1000 = 30



### Input:
 arr[] = [3, 4, 65], start = 7, end = 175


### Output:
 4


### Explanation:

Step 1: 7 * 3 = 21 % 1000 = 21  
Step 2: 21 * 3 = 63 % 1000 = 63  
Step 3: 63 * 65 = 4095 % 1000 = 95  
Step 4: 95 * 65 = 6175 % 1000 = 175 



### Input:
 arr[] = [2, 4], start = 3, end = 5


### Output:
 -1


### Explanation:
 Starting from 3 and multiplying by 2 or 4 always produces even numbers after the first step. Since 5 is odd, it can never be reached.


### Constraints:
1  ≤ arr.size()  ≤ 1031  ≤ arr[i]  ≤ 1030  ≤ start, end  < 103
